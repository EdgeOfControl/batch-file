Mass file copier, mover, and deleter powered by PowerShell

This script will allow you to mass move, copy, or delete files from a PowerShell window. Recursive searching is toggled during runtime.

**How it works:**
     
     - Choose to copy, move, or delete items
     
     - Enter your source folder
     
     - Enter your destination folder (copy and move only)
     
     - Input a filter inclusionary command
     
     - Input a filter exclusionary command (this can be $null if not needed)
     
     - Profit
