Mass file copier, mover, and remover powered by PowerShell

This script will allow you to mass move, copy, or delete files from a PowerShell window. Recursive searching is toggled during runtime.

**How it works:**
     
     - Choose to copy, move, or delete items
     
     - Enter your source folder
     
     - Enter your destination folder (copy and move only)
     
     - Input the first filter
     
     - Input the second filter
     
     - Declare if the search is recursive or not
     
     - Choose the operators to be used in the command (supported: -and, -or, -like, -notlike
     
     - Wait for the command to complete
     
     - Repeat the script or use Ctrl+C to close out of it.
